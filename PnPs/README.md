# Population_specific_CDS.py
This python script will generate a population specific CDS with IUPAC codes at polymorphic sites. It will take a .frq file and a filter for number of chromosomes. 
```
python population_specific_CDS.py -f irish_juvernica.frq -i 10 -o irish_juvernica

-f allele frequncy file generated by vcftools
-i filter for number of induveduals covered (10 if you have 10 diploid individuals)
-o output file name

```
# PnPs_script.py
This python script will callculate PnPs for each gene. 
```
python PnPs_script.py   irish_juvernica.CDS.fasta all > irish_juvernica.table

```
